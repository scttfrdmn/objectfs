# Introduction to ObjectFS

ObjectFS is a high-performance POSIX filesystem that provides seamless access to AWS S3.
It bridges the gap between traditional filesystems and S3 object storage, offering the best
of both worlds with deep S3 optimizations.

## What is ObjectFS?

ObjectFS uses FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) to mount S3 buckets as local directories. This means you can:

- **Use standard file operations** (`ls`, `cat`, `cp`, `mv`, etc.) on S3
- **Run existing applications** without modification  
- **Access massive datasets** stored in S3 as if they were local files
- **Benefit from advanced caching** and performance optimizations

## Key Features

### 🚀 High Performance

- **Multi-level caching** with L1 memory and L2 persistent caches
- **Predictive prefetching** using machine learning models
- **Intelligent eviction** strategies for optimal cache utilization
- **Parallel I/O operations** for maximum throughput

### 🔧 Easy Integration

- **Drop-in replacement** for traditional filesystems
- **POSIX compliance** ensures compatibility with existing tools
- **Multiple mounting options** for different use cases
- **Hot configuration reloading** without unmounting

### 🚀 S3 Deep Integration

- **AWS S3 storage classes** with intelligent tiering support
- **S3 Transfer Acceleration** for faster uploads/downloads
- **S3 lifecycle management** integration
- **Cost optimization** with automatic S3 tiering and storage class transitions

### 🏗️ Enterprise Ready

- **Distributed clusters** for high availability
- **Load balancing** across multiple nodes
- **Health monitoring** and metrics collection
- **Authentication and authorization** with RBAC

### Core Components

1. **FUSE Interface**: Translates POSIX filesystem calls to ObjectFS operations
2. **Cache Layer**: Multi-level caching system with intelligent prefetching
3. **S3 Adapter**: Optimized interface exclusively for AWS S3 with intelligent tiering
4. **Distributed Coordinator**: Manages cluster membership and data consistency
