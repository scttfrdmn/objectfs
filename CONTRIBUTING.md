# Contributing to ObjectFS

We love your input! We want to make contributing to ObjectFS as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.19 or later
- Linux with FUSE support (`sudo modprobe fuse`)
- Make
- Git
- Docker (optional, for integration tests)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/objectfs.git
cd objectfs

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/objectfs/objectfs.git

# Install dependencies
make deps

# Run tests to verify setup
make test
```

## Code Standards

### Go Code Style

We follow standard Go conventions:

- Use `gofmt` for formatting
- Use `go vet` for static analysis
- Follow [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for exported functions and types

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for >90% test coverage
- Write integration tests for critical paths
- Include benchmarks for performance-critical code

Example test structure:
```go
func TestMyFunction(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name     string
        input    string
        expected string
        wantErr  bool
    }{
        {
            name:     "valid input",
            input:    "test",
            expected: "result",
            wantErr:  false,
        },
        // Add more test cases
    }

    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            result, err := MyFunction(tt.input)
            if (err != nil) != tt.wantErr {
                t.Errorf("MyFunction() error = %v, wantErr %v", err, tt.wantErr)
                return
            }
            if result != tt.expected {
                t.Errorf("MyFunction() = %v, want %v", result, tt.expected)
            }
        })
    }
}
```

### Documentation

- Use godoc-style comments for all exported functions and types
- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Add examples in the `examples/` directory
- Update configuration documentation for new config options

## Performance Considerations

ObjectFS is a performance-critical system. When contributing:

- **Profile your changes**: Use Go's built-in profiler to ensure no performance regressions
- **Benchmark critical paths**: Add benchmarks for performance-sensitive code
- **Memory efficiency**: Be mindful of memory allocations in hot paths
- **Concurrency**: Ensure thread-safety without unnecessary locking
- **Caching**: Consider caching implications of your changes

### Running Benchmarks

```bash
# Run all benchmarks
make bench

# Run specific benchmarks
go test -bench=BenchmarkCacheGet ./internal/cache/

# Profile memory usage
go test -bench=. -memprofile=mem.prof ./internal/cache/
go tool pprof mem.prof
```

## Security Considerations

- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials
- Use secure coding practices
- Validate all inputs
- Handle errors appropriately
- Consider security implications of new features
- Report security issues privately to security@objectfs.io

## Issue Reporting

When reporting bugs, please include:

1. **Environment details**: OS, Go version, ObjectFS version
2. **Steps to reproduce**: Clear steps to reproduce the issue
3. **Expected behavior**: What you expected to happen
