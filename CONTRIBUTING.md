## üõ† Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/objectfs.git
   cd objectfs
   ```

2. **Install Pre-commit Hooks**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-hooks.sh
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

4. **Verify Setup**
   ```bash
   go test ./...
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

## üîß Making Changes

### Branch Naming Convention

Use descriptive branch names with prefixes:
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes  
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `test/` - Test improvements
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring

Examples:
- `feature/glacier-deep-archive-support`
- `fix/cache-memory-leak`
- `docs/enterprise-pricing-guide`

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): brief description

Detailed explanation if needed

Fixes #123
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `perf`, `chore`

Examples:
- `feat(s3): add Glacier Deep Archive storage tier support`
- `fix(cache): resolve memory leak in LRU cache implementation`
- `docs(pricing): add enterprise discount configuration guide`

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with coverage
go test -race -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...

# Run specific package tests
go test ./internal/storage/s3/

# Run with verbose output
go test -v ./...
```

### Writing Tests

- Add tests for all new functionality
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate
- Mock external dependencies (AWS API calls)
- Test both success and error cases

Example test structure:
```go
func TestNewFeature(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name     string
        input    InputType
        expected ExpectedType
        wantErr  bool
    }{
        {
            name:     "valid input",
            input:    validInput,
            expected: expectedOutput,
            wantErr:  false,
        },
        // ... more test cases
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            // Test implementation
        })
    }
}
```

### Integration Tests

For integration tests requiring AWS resources:
- Use LocalStack when possible
- Provide clear setup instructions
- Make tests optional if external resources required
- Clean up resources after tests

## üì§ Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure Quality**
   ```bash
   # Pre-commit hooks will run automatically, but you can run manually:
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

2. **Update Documentation**
   - Update README if adding new features
   - Add/update code comments for complex logic
   - Update examples if configuration changes

3. **Create Pull Request**
   - Use descriptive PR title and description
   - Reference related issues
   - Include testing instructions
   - Add screenshots for UI changes (if applicable)
