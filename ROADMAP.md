# ObjectFS Product Roadmap

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** October 15, 2025
**Current Release:** v0.3.0

---

## Executive Summary

ObjectFS is positioned as the **enterprise-grade, cost-intelligent S3 filesystem** that bridges the gap between Amazon File Cache's premium performance and basic S3 filesystem tools. This roadmap outlines our path from the current stable v0.3.0 release to a comprehensive **multi-protocol enterprise data platform** integrated with CargoShip for complete data lifecycle management.

### Strategic Vision

**Short-term (v0.4.0 - v0.5.0):** Solidify position as the leading S3 filesystem with best-in-class performance and cost optimization.

**Mid-term (v0.6.0 - v0.8.0):** Expand to multi-protocol support (SMB, NFS) for enterprise Windows/mixed environments.

**Long-term (v1.0+):** Establish ObjectFS + CargoShip as the unified data platform alternative to Amazon File Cache at 260x lower cost.
