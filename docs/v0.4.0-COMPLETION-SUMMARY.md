## Deferred Items

### CargoShip Integration - Phase 1 ⏸️

**Reason for Deferral:** This is a 4-week architectural task requiring coordination with the CargoShip project. It involves:

- Creating shared Go module repository
- Extracting common S3 optimization libraries
- Unified metrics framework
- Shared compression algorithms (ZSTD, LZ4)

**Recommendation:** Handle as a separate focused effort in coordination with CargoShip team.

### P2 - Enhanced Monitoring ⏸️

**Deferred Features:**

- Detailed performance metrics (per-file latency, detailed cache stats)
- Health check improvements (granular status, remediation actions)
- Enhanced logging (structured logging, log rotation, debug mode)

**Reason for Deferral:** These are polish/monitoring features that can be added in a subsequent release.
Core functionality and performance are complete.

**Note:** Basic monitoring and logging are already in place and functional.

## Conclusion

All **P0 Critical Stability** and **P1 High-Value Performance** features for ObjectFS have been
successfully implemented, tested, and documented. The codebase is race-free, resilient, and
production-ready.

The only deferred P1 item is **CargoShip Integration - Phase 1**, which requires coordination with
an external project and is best handled as a dedicated effort.
