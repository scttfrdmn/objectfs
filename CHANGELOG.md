## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `internal/cache/redis`: Redis-backed distributed cache implementing `types.Cache` — `Cache` struct wraps `go-redis/v9`; `Get` uses `GETRANGE` for partial reads (offset/size support); `Put` stores full objects only (partial writes are silently dropped to maintain cache consistency); `Delete` removes a key; `Evict` increments the eviction counter and returns false (Redis manages eviction via its configured `maxmemory-policy`); `Size` reads `used_memory` from `INFO memory`; `Stats` returns atomic hit/miss/eviction counters and computed hit rate; `Close` closes the connection; `Client` exposes the underlying `*goredis.Client` for invalidation wiring; 13 unit tests using `miniredis/v2` cover connectivity, full/partial reads, partial-write rejection, delete, TTL expiry, namespace isolation, and stats
- `internal/cache/redis`: `Invalidator` — pub/sub cache-invalidation broadcaster on channel `"objectfs:invalidation"`; `Publish(ctx, key)` sends `"<nodeID>:<key>"` messages; `Subscribe(ctx)` starts a goroutine that deletes received keys from the local cache, skipping messages originating from the same node; 3 unit tests cover publish, remote invalidation, and self-publish suppression
- `internal/cache`: `NewFromConfig(cfg)` factory — returns a Redis `Cache` when `cfg.Cluster.Enabled && cfg.Cluster.Redis.Enabled`; falls back to `MultiLevelCache` with defaults otherwise; 3 unit tests cover all three routing paths
- `internal/config`: `RedisConfig` struct with `Enabled`, `Address` (default `localhost:6379`), `Password`, `DB`, `KeyPrefix` (default `"objectfs"`), `TTL` (default 5 min), `MaxRetries` (default 3); `ClusterConfig.Redis RedisConfig` field; defaults wired into `NewDefault()`; `RedisConfig` re-exported via `pkg/types` alias (closes #63)

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- `internal/compression`: adaptive algorithm selection — `Analyze(data)` detects content class (text, JSON, binary, compressed, archive) via magic bytes and Shannon entropy, returning a `CompressScore` ∈ [0,1]; `RuleSelector` maps content class + `AccessHint` (hot/warm/cold) + object size to a `Recommendation` (algorithm + level); `AdaptiveSelector` wraps `RuleSelector` with a per-`ContentClass` rolling-window feedback model — once `minSamples` (10) outcomes are recorded per algorithm it overrides the base recommendation with the empirically best choice (speed-optimised for hot, ratio-optimised for cold); `LZ4Codec` added as a fast-decompression option using `github.com/pierrec/lz4/v4` frame format; `New()` factory extended to support `"lz4"`; 37 new unit tests covering magic-byte detection for 15+ formats, entropy boundary conditions, rule table, adaptive learning, window eviction, and LZ4 round-trip (closes #62)
- `internal/archive`: archive detection and indexing API — `Detect([]ObjectInfo)` filters S3 listings to `[]ArchiveMetadata`; `DetectKeys` returns just the archive keys; `DetectInPrefix(ctx, backend, prefix, limit)` combines `ListObjects` + `Detect`; `IsArchiveKey` wraps `pkg/archive.IsArchive`; `BuildIndex(ctx, backend, key)` downloads and indexes an archive via `GetObject`, supplements with real S3 timestamps from `HeadObject` (non-fatal); `BuildIndexFromBytes(key, format, data)` builds an `ArchiveIndex` by walking tar headers without retaining file data; `openTar` shared by `BuildIndexFromBytes` and `VFS.extractFile`; `pkg/archive.IsArchive` minimum-length guard lowered from 7 to 5 to correctly handle `.tgz` filenames with single-character base names; 21 unit tests for indexing and 14 tests for detection (closes #58)
- `internal/archive`: virtual filesystem (VFS) layer for archive contents — `PathTranslator` splits FUSE paths at archive boundaries (`data.tar.zst/subdir/file.txt` → archiveKey + innerPath) for all three supported formats; `VFS` provides `Stat`, `ReadDir`, and `ReadFile` over archive contents backed by `types.Backend`; index built by walking tar headers on first access (no file data retained) and cached for all subsequent Stat/ReadDir calls; file content extracted on-demand and cached per entry; `Invalidate` clears both index and content caches; synthesises virtual directory entries for archives created without explicit directory records; `ErrNotFound` sentinel error; 28 unit tests cover all three formats, virtual directories, caching, offset reads, and not-found paths (closes #59)
- `internal/network`: TCP congestion control package — runtime detection of available algorithms (`/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_available_congestion_control`), per-socket `TCP_CONGESTION` socket option (Linux ≥ 4.9) via `net.Dialer.Control`; `NewBBRDialer()`, `NewCUBICDialer()`, `BestAvailableDialer()` (BBR > CUBIC > system default); `Monitor` struct with atomic `BytesSent`/`BytesReceived`/`Connections`/`Errors` counters and `WrapDialContext` for transparent tracking; `BBRConfig` with 4 MiB send/receive buffers and ICW=10; build-tag stubs for non-Linux platforms; `NewDialer(algo)` wired into `s3.NewClientManager` via custom `*http.Transport.DialContext`; `CongestionAlgorithm` field added to `s3.Config` and `config.NetworkConfig` (default `"auto"`); unit tests cover algorithm selection, detection, Monitor lifecycle, WrapDialContext success/error, and BBR config (closes #60)
- `pkg/compression` + `internal/compression`: ZSTD compression engine with configurable levels (1–22) using `github.com/klauspost/compress/zstd`; public `Codec` interface (`Compress`, `Decompress`, `Algorithm`, `ContentEncoding`) and `Algorithm` constants (`zstd`, `gzip`, `lz4`, `none`); `ZstdCodec` using concurrency-safe `EncodeAll`/`DecodeAll`; `Compressor` wrapper with minimum-size threshold and incompressibility guard (discards compressed form when it is not smaller than the original); transparent S3 integration — `PutObject` compresses and sets `Content-Encoding: zstd`; `GetObject` fetches the full object when compression is active, decompresses, then slices to the requested byte range; multipart uploads propagate `Content-Encoding` through `CreateMultipartUpload`; default config: algorithm=zstd, level=3, minSize=4KB; unit tests (40 tests, no AWS required) cover round-trip, all levels 1–22, concurrent access, incompressible data, parseSize, and Compressor lifecycle (closes #61)
- C SDK (`sdks/c/`): shared library (`libobjectfs.so`/`.dylib`) via `go build -buildmode=c-shared`; public header `objectfs.h` with full documented API; opaque handle system with per-handle error strings; operations: New, Free, Get, Put, Delete, Head, List, Mount, Unmount, LastError, FreeData, FreeList; C test suite (16 tests) and Python ctypes smoke test (15 tests) both pass without AWS credentials; integration tests gated on `OBJECTFS_TEST_BUCKET` + `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` (closes #71)
- Go SDK (`sdks/go/objectfs`): type-safe client for direct S3 object operations (Get, Put, Delete, List, Head) and optional FUSE mount/unmount; functional options (WithRegion, WithEndpoint, WithCacheSize, WithMaxConcurrency, WithLogLevel, WithMetricsPort, WithHealthPort, WithTLS); five sentinel errors (ErrNotFound, ErrAccessDenied, ErrNotMounted, ErrAlreadyMounted, ErrInvalidConfig) compatible with errors.Is; unit tests for all options and error-path logic without AWS credentials (closes #70)
- `pkg/archive`: new package with `ArchiveMetadata`, `ArchiveIndex`, and `ArchiveEntry` types; format detection via `IsArchive()` for tar.zst, tar.gz, and tar.bz2 — objectfs-side metadata types for CargoShip archive integration
- Python SDK (`sdks/python/objectfs`): async/await S3 client, CLI, monitoring, and configuration presets; GCS/Azure backends stubbed for future support
- `internal/fuse`: unit tests for `ReadAheadManager` (pattern detection, sequential/non-sequential reads, prefetch scheduling, TTL cleanup), `WriteCoalescer` (accumulation, merge, flush triggers), `Stats` (concurrent safety), and config defaults; cgofuse mock-based tests for Getattr, Open/Read, Write, Release, Readdir, and concurrent handle management (gated behind `//go:build cgofuse`)

### Changed
- Upgraded `github.com/scttfrdmn/cargoship` v0.4.5 → v0.13.0 (DVC pipeline auto-discovery, archive filesystem shell, Glacier restore, incremental sync, deduplication)
- Go toolchain bumped to 1.26.0 (pulled in by cargoship v0.13.0)
- Transitive upgrades: `aws-sdk-go-v2` v1.39.2 → v1.41.0, `testify` v1.10.0 → v1.11.1
- Dockerfile base image updated: `golang:1.24-alpine` → `golang:1.26-alpine`, `alpine:3.18` → `alpine:3.21`

### Fixed
- `internal/storage/s3`: refactored `putObjectMultipart` (209 lines → 55 lines) by extracting five helper methods into `multipart_upload.go` — `initiateMultipartUpload`, `uploadSinglePart`, `uploadParts`, `abortMultipartUpload`, `completeMultipartUpload`; pure `partSlice` helper extracted and covered by `TestPartSlice` (5 subtests) (closes #55)
- `internal/adapter`: removed hardcoded `us-west-2` region; adapter now reads `Storage.S3.Region`, `Storage.S3.Endpoint`, `Storage.S3.ForcePathStyle`, and `Storage.S3.UseAcceleration` from `config.Configuration` via new `buildS3Config()` helper (closes #56)
- `internal/config`: added `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`, `AWS_REGION`, `OBJECTFS_S3_REGION`, and `OBJECTFS_S3_ENDPOINT` environment variable mappings so region and endpoint are configurable without a config file; priority order is `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` < `AWS_REGION` < `OBJECTFS_S3_REGION`
- `internal/health`: implemented all 8 `AutoFix` remediation closures — `memory_force_gc` (runtime.GC + debug.FreeOSMemory), `disk_clean_logs` (removes .log files older than 30 days), `disk_clean_cache` (removes objectfs-cache files older than 7 days), `disk_clean_temp` (removes objectfs-* temp files older than 24h), `network_retry` (context-aware 5 s wait); `s3_restart_connection`, `cache_clear`, and `memory_reduce_cache` log advisory messages until dependency injection is available
- License references updated from MIT to Apache 2.0 throughout README, SDKs, and docs
- Copyright year updated to 2025-2026
- Pre-commit `check-yaml` hook now uses `--unsafe` to handle MkDocs Python YAML tags
- Markdownlint config: relax line-length limit and allow emphasis for README badge lines
